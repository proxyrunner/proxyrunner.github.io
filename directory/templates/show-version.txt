PCI bus mb0_mb1 (Slots 0, 1, 3 and 5) has a capacity of 600 bandwidth points.
Current configuration on bus mb0_mb1 has a total of 1600 bandwidth points. 
The set of PA-2FE, PA-POS-2OC3, and I/O-2FE qualify for "half 
bandwidth points" consideration, when full bandwidth point counting 
results in oversubscription, under the condition that only one of the 
two ports is used. With this adjustment, current configuration on bus 
mb0_mb1 has a total of 1200 bandwidth points. 
This configuration has oversubscripted the PCI bus and is not a 
supported configuration. 

PCI bus mb2 (Slots 2, 4, 6) has a capacity of 600 bandwidth points.
Current configuration on bus mb2 has a total of 1200 bandwidth points 
The set of PA-2FE, PA-POS-2OC3, and I/O-2FE qualify for "half 
bandwidth points" consideration, when full bandwidth point counting 
results in oversubscription, under the condition that only one of the 
two ports is used. With this adjustment, current configuration on bus 
mb2 has a total of 1000 bandwidth points. 
This configuration has oversubscripted the PCI bus and is not a 
supported configuration.
